## Allowing Combinational Loops

```
set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS true [get_nets -of_objects [get_cells q_OBUF_inst_i_1]]
set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS true [get_nets { q } ]
set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS true [get_nets { qbar }]
set_property SEVERITY {Warning}  [get_drc_checks LUTLP-1] 
set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1]
set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1]
```



```
module my_module (
   input wire clk_pin,
   output reg pmod_pin0,
   // other module ports
);

assign pmod_pin0 <= clk_pin;

// rest of the module code
endmodule
```

The "<=" operator is the non-blocking assignment operator in Verilog. It is used to assign a value to a signal, register or wire asynchronously, without blocking the execution of the current process or thread.

In the context of connecting the H16 clock pin of PYNQ-Z2 to a Pmod pin using Verilog, we use the "<=" operator to make an assignment between the H16 input signal and the output signal of the Pmod pin.

This is important because the clock signal on the H16 pin is generated by an external clock source, and we want to ensure that any changes in the clock signal are propagated to the output Pmod pin as soon as possible, without introducing any delays or blocking the execution of other processes or threads.

By using the non-blocking assignment operator, we can ensure that the assignment is made asynchronously and without blocking the execution of other processes, which is critical in designs where timing and clock synchronization are important.

If you use the "=" operator instead of the "<=" operator to make the assignment between the H16 input signal and the output signal of the Pmod pin, you would be using the blocking assignment operator in Verilog.

The "=" operator blocks the execution of the current process or thread until the assignment is complete. This means that if you use the "=" operator in this case, the execution of the current process or thread would be blocked until the H16 input signal changes, which could introduce delays in the propagation of the clock signal to the output Pmod pin.

In other words, using the "=" operator in this context could potentially introduce synchronization and timing issues, especially if the clock frequency is high or the design is complex.

Therefore, it is recommended to use the non-blocking assignment operator "<=" in this case, to ensure that the clock signal is propagated to the output Pmod pin as soon as possible, without introducing any delays or blocking the execution of other processes or threads.
